Vibe coded and slop based. I asked for three different example scripts and they all suck, can't use my actual transcripts, too lazy to make one up. No one else will ever even need this so deal with it if you do. 
Okay, I understand! You're looking for an example that's much more out there, surreal, and "insane" to really showcase the script with some flair. Let's try something that hopefully hits that mark.

The Python script (format_transcript.py) itself will remain unchanged, as its functionality is sound. This update is purely for the example in the README.md.

Here's the revised README.md with a new, hopefully "insane" enough, demonstration:

# Transcript Formatter: Bold Speaker Turns

This Python script processes a diarized transcript text file and applies Markdown bold formatting to the entire turn of a specified speaker. A "turn" includes the speaker's tag (e.g., `[Speaker Name]`) and all subsequent lines of their speech until another speaker tag is encountered.

## Requirements

- Python 3

## Usage

Run the script from your terminal using the `python` interpreter:

```
python format_transcript.py <input_file> <output_file> --speaker "<speaker_label>"
```

Arguments:

    <input_file>: Path to the original transcript .txt file.
    <output_file>: Path to save the modified transcript .txt file.
    --speaker "<speaker_label>": Required. The exact label of the speaker whose turns you want to bold.
        Provide the name or label as it appears inside the brackets in the transcript (e.g., "Speaker 1", "Alice", "Dr. Smith").
        If the speaker label contains spaces, it's good practice to enclose it in quotes when providing it as an argument (e.g., --speaker "Speaker 1").

Example Command:

To bold all turns for [The Grand Flumph] in edict_of_noodle.txt and save to edict_formatted.txt:
Bash

python format_transcript.py edict_of_noodle.txt edict_formatted.txt --speaker "The Grand Flumph"

If the speaker label is "Zorp" (i.e., [Zorp] in the transcript):
Bash

python format_transcript.py cosmic_ravings.txt cosmic_ravings_zorp_bold.txt --speaker "Zorp"

Demonstration (Before & After)

Let's say you have an input file (the_cheese_prophecy.txt) with the following content:

Before (the_cheese_prophecy.txt):
Plaintext
```
[Narrator X]
The moon, a gouda of forgotten dreams, hung low. Sir Reginald Featherbottom III adjusted his tinfoil cravat.

[Sir Reginald Featherbottom III]
By Jove! The squirrels are telepathic tonight!
They speak of the imminent arrival of the Cosmic Wombat!
He demands tribute – a single, perfectly toasted crumpet!

[The Ominous Doorbell]
DING-DONG! DING-DONG! DING-DONG! DING-DONG! DING-DONG!

[Sir Reginald Featherbottom III]
Blast and bother! Is that him already?
Or merely the existential dread of Tuesday afternoons personified?
One can never be too sure in these trying times of rogue punctuation!

[Narrator X]
Indeed. The stakes, and the crumpets, were high.
```

If you run the script to bold turns for "Sir Reginald Featherbottom III":
Bash

python format_transcript.py the_cheese_prophecy.txt the_cheese_prophecy_bolded.txt --speaker "Sir Reginald Featherbottom III"

The output file (the_cheese_prophecy_bolded.txt) will look like this:

After (the_cheese_prophecy_bolded.txt):
Plaintext
```
[Narrator X]
The moon, a gouda of forgotten dreams, hung low. Sir Reginald Featherbottom III adjusted his tinfoil cravat.

**[Sir Reginald Featherbottom III]**
**By Jove! The squirrels are telepathic tonight!**
**They speak of the imminent arrival of the Cosmic Wombat!**
**He demands tribute – a single, perfectly toasted crumpet!**

[The Ominous Doorbell]
DING-DONG! DING-DONG! DING-DONG! DING-DONG! DING-DONG!

**[Sir Reginald Featherbottom III]**
**Blast and bother! Is that him already?**
**Or merely the existential dread of Tuesday afternoons personified?**
**One can never be too sure in these trying times of rogue punctuation!**

[Narrator X]
Indeed. The stakes, and the crumpets, were high.
```
Input Format Assumptions

The script expects the transcript to follow these conventions:

    Speaker tags (e.g., [Speaker 1], [Alice]) are on their own lines.
    The speaker label provided via the --speaker argument matches the text inside the brackets in the transcript exactly (this comparison is case-sensitive).
    Blank lines are preserved. Speech lines for the target speaker are bolded; blank lines within their turn are not.


How's this? Hopefully, "Sir Reginald Featherbottom III" and "The Ominous Doorbell" bring the right kind of delightful absurdity to the example!
